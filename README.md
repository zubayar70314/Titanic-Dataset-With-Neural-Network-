# Titanic-Dataset-Wth-Neural-Network-
OVERVIEW: 
We will take titanic dataset there will be some columns like Passenger, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Ticket etc. We will use some python tools to predict that which passenger
will survive which passenger will not. Because when the Titanic sank that time survival team gave priority some passengers to see some things There were just enough rafts to 
save about a portion of the 2228 travelers and team. Individuals who wound up in the freezing sea waters couldn't keep going long. This implied that more than 1500 individuals 
passed on in the fiasco, while just 705 individuals endure. Jack Phillips went down with the boat. A portion of the travelers who passed on were exceptionally rich and well 
known. Be that as it may, this rundown name a portion of the 721 second rate class travelers who died. Travelers' odds of endurance to a great extent relied upon the class 
wherein they were voyaging. Ladies and kids voyaging first and below average were given need for getting into the rafts and the greater part of these were saved. Top of the 
line travelers overall fared the best, with about 60% enduring. Just 25% of second-rate class voyagers were protected. So, we will predict who will survive who will not from 
the Titanic dataset.
